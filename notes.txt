we have ascertained that the pixel data remains consistent (changes after watermarking and is restored correctly)
and so does the metadata (does not change). For this we printed the metadata to a file at various points and hashed the contents of the file
using Get-FileHash in powershell. For the numpy array we used the function in write_nparr_to_file to dump the whole 
array to a file and compared hashes again at various points. 
Thus we found they were consistent. Proof is in this image

to find time per module do
import time
st = time.time()

and at the end time.time()-st
